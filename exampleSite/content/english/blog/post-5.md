All children are artists, and their main challenge as life moves forward is "how do you remain one when you grow up"? When did your world-view start shifting, where you moved away from the old version of you that sketched and carried out half-baked ideas, all to join Corporate America in the spirit of creating value for corporations? 

I remember the day I came home from school and asked my mom if I could take a class about how to make video games. Back then, we could not afford to buy games or a gaming console, so I wanted to take matters into my own hands and make them myself. After my first experience with Scratch, MIT's platform to entice children to practice computational thinking (not MIT's first rodeo [tricking pebbles to think](https://www.ll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/facility/doc/2018-05/MITLL_MEL20innovations.pdf)), I fell in love with creation, spending every waking hour and sleepless nights doing projects that did not feel dumb to me.

I started trading my creativity for memorization and my imagination for critical thinking.

So I made Woven World! I have so much more to say about Woven World, but that will have to wait for another day when I have time to update this article.

Au revoir.
