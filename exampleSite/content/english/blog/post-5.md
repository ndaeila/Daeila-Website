All children are artists, and their main challenge as life moves forward is "how do you remain one when you grow up"? When did your world-view start shifting, where you moved away from the old version of you that sketched and carried out half-baked ideas, all to join Corporate America in the spirit of creating value for corporations? 

I remember the day I came home from school and asked my mom if I could take a class about how to make video games. Back then, we could not afford to buy games or a gaming console, so I wanted to take matters into my own hands and make them myself. After my first experience with Scratch, MIT's platform to entice children to practice computational thinking (not MIT's first rodeo [tricking pebbles to think](https://www.ll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/facility/doc/2018-05/MITLL_MEL20innovations.pdf)), I fell in love with creation, spending every waking hour and sleepless nights doing projects that did not feel dumb to me.

But once I started prioritizing my grades come Middle School and Scratch started feeling immature, my innate whimsical nature dissipated to make room for a highly motivated perfectionist to rise from the ashes ready to pursue test scores - and as a result, extrinsic motivation proved to be a double-edged sword. I started trading my creativity for memorization and my imagination for critical thinking. 

**Only recently** did I find another opportunity to get back in touch with my old self - the one that spent all of their nights awake to make something that feels cool to me alone.
