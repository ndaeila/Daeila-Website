All children are artists, and their main challenge as life moves forward is "how do you remain one when you grow up"?

I remember the day I came home from school and asked my mom if I could take a class about how to make video games. Back then, we could not afford to buy games or a gaming console, so I wanted to take matters into my own hands and make them myself. After my first experience with Scratch, MIT's platform to entice children to practice computational thinking, I fell in love with creation, spending every waking hour doing projects that felt important to 5th grade me.

But once I started prioritizing my grades come Middle School, and Scratch started feeling immature, I started trading my creativity for memorization and my imagination for critical thinking. Only recently did I get a lot of opportunities at University to be more creative, and I've been having a lot of fun with it. One thing I have been meaning to try again is making a game...

So I made Woven World!

#### Woven World
Woven World is a Pokemon-style game where you move from block to block exploring the map. When you click on a clickable asset, you get interactive popups that teach you about the intricacies about the textile industry.

I have so much more to say about Woven World, but that will have to wait for another day when I have time to update this article. Thank you for reading, and please give it a try!
