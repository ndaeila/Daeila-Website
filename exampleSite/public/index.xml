To make my goal a reality, I decided to learn Mandarin Chinese, the primary language in Shenzhen, China. I quickly realized learning Chinese is difficult - the Chinese character set, Hanzi, is different from the English alphabet, in that the symbols illustrate meanings instead of representing phonetic sounds. I searched on Google for the best way to learn Chinese, and the first result was &lt;em>Duolingo&lt;/em>, an application that I initially heard about from Social Media.

My name is Nathan Daeila, and along with my colleague Ben Price, we set out on a journey not just to develop an application but to create a meaningful solution to a critical problem facing our healthcare system: the nursing shortage. This narrative isn&amp;rsquo;t about pitching an app; it&amp;rsquo;s about sharing our journey, our challenges, our intentions, and everything else that went into making &lt;em>Oxygen&lt;/em> a reality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome to My Tech Blog Journey!</title><link>http://localhost:1313/blog/post-1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/post-1/</guid><description>&lt;h5 id="hello-and-welcome">Hello and Welcome!&lt;/h5>

&lt;p>I am Nathan Daeila, an aspiring Product Manager driven by a vision where every challenge is a stepping stone to innovation. Starting in the tech world as an IT intern during a global chip shortage, I quickly learned that when resources are scarce, creativity must flourish. Repairing computers and laptops was just the beginning; I soon found myself automating tasks in the IT department, paving my way to a role as a Systems Administrator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>http://localhost:1313/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/contact/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="contact-me">Contact Me&lt;/h1>
