[{"categories":["AI","Web-Dev","Product"],"contents":"Redesigning the internet for User Experience was hard enough - but humans aren\u0026rsquo;t the only users of the internet anymore. We may need to redesign every website, app, and service for the Consumer AI Assistants of 2030\u0026hellip; I understand how this sounds like an overexaggeration, but bear with me.\nThe CEO of Netlify just coined a groundbreaking new term \u0026ldquo;Agent Experience\u0026rdquo; (AX) and nobody\u0026rsquo;s talking about it yet. Here\u0026rsquo;s exactly why we need to start thinking about AX:\n1) AI is being used to advise people\u0026rsquo;s product choices. And I don\u0026rsquo;t just mean asking ChatGPT which product is best. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained by scraping the web. That means every new-age app with AI Agent features will use web-scraped knowledge to operate. If the features of your website are not web-scraper accessible, chances are the apps of 2028 will not recommend or use your tools.\nBut even if you fully optimize your site for web-scraper access, the logical, pragmatic AI Agents (different from web-scrapers) of the future viewing and interacting with your website may see through your clever Marketing/UX/Sales tactics and weigh options pragmatically for their human. Here is a condensed version of the conversations I imagine will happen between Siri in 2030 and a human:\nHuman: \u0026ldquo;I want to book a flight to Seattle for Wednesday.\u0026rdquo;\nSiri: \u0026ldquo;Sure. Do you want to book a round-trip or one-way?\u0026rdquo;\nHuman: \u0026ldquo;One-way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip; (more back-and-forth conversation over preference) \u0026hellip;\nSiri: \u0026ldquo;Okay, I found 2 flights that match your preferences. The flight from Booking.com is cheapest, but the one from Expedia comes with free cancellation â€“ which one should I book?\u0026rdquo;\nAs you can see, the human never interacts with your website. Instead, the AI Agent acts as a proxy and makes it happen.\nHuman â†’ AI Agent â†’ Computer Interaction considerations will make or break your existing sales funnel.\n2) Human â†’ AI Agent â†’ Computer Interaction AI Agent task automation will rely on \u0026ldquo;AI Agent Accessibility\u0026rdquo; (I think I just coined this term).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say in the year 2032 you tell Siri to book a flight on your behalf to Seattle on the 7th of April. In the backend, Siri might try to book it using a new browser automation feature akin to OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s Operator and Anthropic\u0026rsquo;s Computer Use.\nBut if a given Flights website like Expedia does not have buttons with a clear call-to-action that is easily identifiable by an LLM, Siri the AI Agent may pivot to a competitor website, and you may lose the sale.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not all â€“ the functionality of your site may restrict/limit AI Agents.\n2FA/CAPTCHA: AI Agents Hate Them If Siri\u0026rsquo;s future automation feature opens a website, tries to log into your account, then gets blocked by 2FA or CAPTCHA, the flight cannot get booked, regardless of how accessible your website is.\nðŸ”— Apple\u0026rsquo;s solution to the CAPTCHA problem Page Load Time: AI Agents are Impatient Web Scraper navigation velocity will be faster than a human. Even though 1-second page load times are okay for humans, an AI Agent may miss information on your website that fails to load within a reasonable amount of time. Dynamic webpages may cause AI-Agent Accessibility issues if they take too long to load. If Siri the AI Agent cannot find the search bar on your site on time, or does not see the \u0026ldquo;Book a Flight\u0026rdquo; button, it may pivot to a competitor site prematurely to provide its human faster results.\n3) AI Agent â†’ Computer Interaction AI Agents need tools and infrastructure to interact with (need proof? Take a look into Netlify\u0026rsquo;s recent success collaborating with Bolt.new).\nBefore Web 2.0, there was almost no Human Interaction with websites, other than viewing content. Web 2.0 introduced the CRUD app, enabling more types of Human Interaction and creating more value from the internet.\nJust like humans need buttons and a proper GUI to interact with, AI Agents will require similar tailor-made interfaces. Fortunately, AI-Agent Experience and Software Developer Experience have a lot in common:\nAI Agents will interact with the world using APIs, so building backends with uniform procedures such as RESTful APIs with metadata descriptors will enable AI Agents to understand your website and use your APIs frictionlessly, just like how an end-user frictionlessly uses a well-designed graphical interface.\nRemember using AWS for the first time and you had to log into the console and build stuff by hand? You had to spin up an EC2 instance or write code directly into a Lambda function. AWS CloudFormation and Cloud Development Kit (CDK) fixed that by allowing developers to spin up templated infrastructure directly from the command line â€“ Infrastructure as Code.\nLikewise, AI Agents will use these same types of affordances to build.\nSay itâ€™s the year 2030 again and your company just bought a new server. What if all you had to do is install a blank instance of AWS-Cloud OS (I think Coolify \u0026amp; Ubicloud is already doing this part) onto that server, then you told the AI Agent on your laptop to build an app on that server?\nNow, instead of spending months managing server infrastructure, or relying on the nice abstractions that come with AWS Cloud, you just spin up a server and it automatically provides you the same features as the largest cloud provider â€“ and the AI Agent uses that equipment on your behalf, in the most efficient way possible.\nThere are so many more considerations at play - none of which are fully-researched yet. But Moral of the Story - instead of being another company that adds a new variety of chat bot to your site, consider redesigning your website from the ground up to support the inevitably autonomous future.\nThink about the affordances, allowances, and user flows you would like to provide to the consumer/business AI Agents of 2030, and make sure you build your products with AI Agent Accessibility in mind.\nðŸ”— Read the original article by Netlify CEO Mathias Biilmann ","date":"February 5, 2025","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/06_hu_9230b2156e70d83e.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/06_hu_298b21dea0bf72df.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/06_hu_d7a93d45bacbb48d.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/06_hu_18994b0b5647334a.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/06_hu_88981674d54bf9e.png\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"1792\" height=\"1024\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/post-6/","title":"Every Website Needs to be Redesigned (Again) for Agent Experience (AX)"},{"categories":["Portfolio","Web-Dev","Game"],"contents":"All children are artists, and their main challenge as life moves forward is \u0026ldquo;how do you remain one when you grow up\u0026rdquo;?\nI remember the day I came home from school and asked my mom if I could take a class about how to make video games.

After a school quarter of manipulating and analyzing dots (from 3 completely unrelated projects), I want to bring to attention my semi-new favorite way to visualize a network of seemingly unrelated data points.\nEmotion Graph\nThe Shape of Emotion: Testing Pre-Trained Models with the Tool Recently, I have been encountering a reoccurring need to create visualizations that help me spatially understand the shape and contents of my data post-processing\u0026hellip; that is, before I know what insights I intend to uncover from the data. My problem is, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make 80 different visualizations from every angle of my data every I want to explore what my data looks like, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have the patience to read and interpret all the rows of my data one-by-one. However, without fully understanding what my data looks like or how it\u0026rsquo;s shaped, I have a hard time finding patterns in my data worth analyzing, or how to best fit predictive models to my data.\nIn a perfect world, I would have a quick tool at my fingertips that helps me understand my data with little to no bootstrapping.\nI thought back to an internship I had a while ago, while I was still in the SWE womb trying to comprehend the complexities of basic Git usage. We had access to this amazing tool that allowed us to see how data looks in 3D space, once the DS team vectorized it for our purposes and flattened the dimensions. And most importantly, every time I used this tool, I found new insights and eureka moments that led to more questions that I wanted to answer. I knew at that point that I had to recreate the tool, but fix some of the pain points that constrained the tool to only proprietary purposes.\nSo as I brought this visualization tool to light, I made certain that the tool could be repurposed with ease, so I can apply it to all of my projects related to spatial data analysis. For testing, I decided to try RoBERTa using data from Flickr about Obama in the year(s) before he got elected. Here is a link to access the website: Emotion Profile Dev + Design Process Believe it or not, creating a 3D Exploratory Data Analysis Tool was as straightforward as creating one in 2D, so naturally I opted to create a 3D tool.\nI found a package for React called React-Force-Graph which allows you to position nodes and create edges as you like within 3D space (which looks awesome). The best part is, it\u0026rsquo;s fully customizable because on the backend it\u0026rsquo;s just Three.js, and the amount of detail in the documentation is surreal.\nThe only caveat - since it is a force graph, forces are applied between the nodes. It\u0026rsquo;s important to set parameter forceEngine=\u0026ldquo;none\u0026rdquo; and charge={0} to remove meddling, specially if there are links between nodes, because forces from links and other nodes will move nodes out of their respective coordinates (but I recommend leaving the charge parameter alone because its effects are miniscule). After turning the forceEngine off, react-force-graph became exactly what I needed to put my nodes in 3D space.\nAnother drawback was the lack of interactivity, so I dressed up the application by adding features like Settings and the Node Information Popup (when you click a node) to enhance the user\u0026rsquo;s ability to explore the data on a granular level. Additionally, I wanted node colors to be obvious, particularly since colors are used to better understand the position of the dots, so I added a Color Legend, making it easy to understand what is classified where, and by what intensity.\nI also added Light and Dark Mode, because I would never dare forget to give users the option, even though they will just use Dark Mode by default.\nThis article is a draft. Upcoming changes for this article: more images, more details about emotion data, other use cases of graph, better explanation of how to use it, many corrections (if I have time).\n","date":"December 5, 2024","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/04_hu_27fad3b4adfd9475.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/04_hu_c15bfbbbf16da0fc.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/04_hu_9fc2787656a3939a.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/04_hu_f8bfb774f76b24f2.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/04_hu_c2a80efa61eb3b8b.png\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"989\" height=\"400\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/post-4/","title":"What shape are your emotions?"},{"categories":["Portfolio","Human-Centered","Product","Analysis"],"contents":"\u0026ldquo;I want to spend a year in Shenzhen,\u0026rdquo; I mentioned to my friends, with no reasonable explanation. To make my goal a reality, I decided to learn Mandarin Chinese, the primary language in Shenzhen, China. I quickly realized learning Chinese is difficult - the Chinese character set, Hanzi, is different from the English alphabet, in that the symbols illustrate meanings instead of representing phonetic sounds. I searched on Google for the best way to learn Chinese, and the first result was Duolingo, an application that I initially heard about from Social Media. Duolingo is instantly recognizable for its mascot, a green, pudgy owl, now celebrated as a TikTok celebrity and familiar to many teenagers and adults.\nDuolingo is a language learning application that captivates its users by gamifying the process of language acquisition. It goes beyond the basics, ensuring every facet of the app is engaging, much like a game. This includes the competitive League System, motivating Streaks, and the rewarding cycle of awards and achievements. These features are meticulously crafted to enhance the user experience, motivating learners to engage with multiple Duolingo lessons daily.\nMaintaining Commitment to Duolingo The Duolingo application has mechanisms that work together to convince users to take lessons on a regular (multiple lessons on a daily) basis. Users are inclined to continue their lessons every day, and if they want to keep their league, they need to do an average of multiple lessons a day. Here is a breakdown of the features involved that require commitment from their users:\nThe Streak System: Forgiveness and Goals Streaks are one of the most powerful tools of the decade for fostering loyalty in applications. Many games reward users for maintaining long streaks, and platforms like Snapchat use streaks to symbolize the strength of friendships. The desire to keep a streak going stems from the effort required to build and maintain a sizeable streak. Losing a streak can be discouraging, making it challenging to regain the same level of motivation to start over. Duolingo is well aware of this dynamic and leverages the Streak System to encourage daily engagement from its users. They reward continuous streaks and frequently remind users to maintain their streak, creating significant pressure to keep up the daily habit, visible through persistent notifications and prompts on the home screen. The emphasis on streaks significantly boosts Duolingo\u0026rsquo;s user engagement, creating a sense of daily commitment similar to showcasing long Snapchat streaks among friends. Duolingo has mastered the use of streaks to maintain high levels of user activity, making it a key component of their success in keeping users consistently engaged.\nForgiveness: The Streak Freeze However, Duolingo offers a safety net for those who might miss a day: the Streak Freeze. This feature, often awarded to users, allows for the preservation of a streak for an additional day if a user fails to complete a lesson.\nThere are many names for this strategy. Educators call this a Second Chance strategy and UX designers call this feature a \u0026ldquo;forgiveness\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;re-engagement\u0026rdquo; mechanism. This strategy helps prevent the demotivation that comes with losing a long streak, ensuring users feel encouraged to continue their lessons without interruption.\nGoals: The Streak Challenge Duolingo takes the streak a step further by creating a Streak Challenge. Users are challenged to go days without breaking their streak. Users have the choice to select 7, 14, or 30 days for your Streak Challenge length, which gives users the freedom to give themselves a challenge they feel they can reach. By doing this, users have a shorter goal to work toward that gives a reward for maintaining the streak. Otherwise, users would have to settle for the longer-term rewards for long streaks, given at 50 days, 100 days, 150 days, and 365 days.\nYou will notice that in the Duolingo app, there is a pattern of creating systems that use Implementation Intentions to create features that have the user create an intentional commitment of continue their streak, word toward their goal, and stay consistent.\n\u0026ldquo;If I need to prolong my streak today, then I will complete a Duolingo lesson in order to work toward my goal of 30 days for my Streak Challenge; otherwise, I will lose my 116 day streak.\u0026rdquo;\nThe application creates a framework for users that allows them to decide to take action toward a goal, which in turn, helps solidify a user\u0026rsquo;s intention to return for their Chinese lessons while giving them an impression of autonomy.\nLeague System: Keep Your Spot! The League System in Duolingo adds a competitive twist by grouping users to vie against one another. Winning comes in various forms, but there\u0026rsquo;s a clear path to losing: landing in the Demotion Zone with one of the lowest scores at the league\u0026rsquo;s conclusion results in demotion. Stay above this threshold, and you maintain your current standing or, if you\u0026rsquo;re in the Promotion Zone, ascend to the next league.\nLeagues offer more than just competition; they present a challenge of upkeep similar to maintaining a streak. Failing to earn enough XP from lessons means falling back to a previous league, which can feel like a setback after investing considerable effort. Climbing back to a former league is possible, yet it demands a significant commitment, pushing users to complete enough lessons to avoid demotion.\nDespite the pressure leagues might impose, opting out isn\u0026rsquo;t an option. Completion of a league automatically enrolls users in the next cycle post-lesson. This means users are continuously engaged in either staving off demotion or striving for promotion, ensuring a persistent, if challenging, engagement with the app. While lessons seem to be fun, features like these make it more stressful to have fun doing lessons, as there is a larger matter at hand: maintaining your level or moving to the next level. This competition-stimulating feature is an example of The Overjustification Effect, and how rewards may cause people to lose motivation for activities they used to believe were fun. Instead of the users wanting to do lessons, this system causes users feel like they need to do lessons to maintain their standing.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Let Your Friend Down: Friend Quests You wouldn't want to let your friend down, would you? If you do, they'll know. The Friend Quests feature in Duolingo pairs you with a mutual friend from the list of people you follow on the platform, fostering accountability for both of you to complete these quests. This way, your commitment isn't just to the app but also to your friend who depends on your contribution, just as you depend on theirs. Unlike the League System, Friend Quests are set automatically, but with a significant distinction: you sometimes have the option to choose the friend with whom you want to complete the quest. By initiating a Friend Quest, Duolingo offers another incentive to return to the app: to undertake lessons that keep you accountable to your friends. Furthermore, the app empowers you to choose your quest partner, potentially leading to selections based on who you value more, enhancing the personal connection to the learning journey.

My name is Nathan Daeila, and along with my colleague Ben Price, we set out on a journey not just to develop an application but to create a meaningful solution to a critical problem facing our healthcare system: the nursing shortage. This narrative isn\u0026rsquo;t about pitching an app; it\u0026rsquo;s about sharing our journey, our challenges, our intentions, and everything else that went into making Oxygen a reality.\nUnderstanding the Magnitude of the Nursing Shortage To grasp the depth of the issue we aimed to address, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to consider key statistics that highlight the severity of the nursing shortage:\nProjected Recruitment Needs for the next 10 Years The Bureau of Labor Statisticsâ€™ Employment Projections for 2021-2031 indicate that the Registered Nursing (RN) workforce is expected to grow by only 6%, from 3.1 million to 3.3 million nurses, but we need that growth every single year to catch up! There will be approximately 203,200 openings for RNs each year through 2031 considering nurse retirements and workforce exits, totalling to around 1.8 million open nurse positions. This statistic underscores not just the growing need for nurses, but also the turnover and retirement rates affecting the workforce.\nShortage Across the States The United States Registered Nurse Workforce Report Card and Shortage Forecast, as published in the American Journal of Medical Quality, projects a significant RN shortage in 30 states, with the most intense shortage in the Western region of the U.S. This state-by-state analysis paints a picture of a nationwide challenge, varying in intensity but uniformly critical.\nThe Entire Workforce is Retiring A 2020 National Nursing Workforce Survey found that the average age of an RN is 52 years old. This data suggests a looming wave of retirements over the next 15 years, exacerbating the shortage as experienced nurses leave the workforce.\nThe Conception of Oxygen The genesis of Oxygen was born out of a discussion about family members in healthcare that quickly escalated into a profound realization - we noticed that the increasingly generous salaries in the healthcare system, particularly in nursing positions, are due to a serious shortage in nurses. There is a growing demand for nurses, yet fewer people are choosing nursing as a career path. This discrepancy isn\u0026rsquo;t just a statistic; it is a preventable challenge to public health and safety.\nDriven by a desire to make a difference, Ben and I pondered over how we, as students with a passion for STEM and social good, could contribute to solving this problem. Thus, the concept of Oxygen was born - a digital platform envisioned to bridge the gap between aspiring healthcare professionals and the healthcare industry\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nThe Heart of Oxygen: Empowering Aspiring Nurses The primary goal of Oxygen is straightforward yet ambitious: to empower individuals to join the healthcare workforce. We wanted to create a platform that simplified the process of finding healthcare-related jobs and training opportunities. But Oxygen is more than a mere job listing app; it is about inspiring a new generation to consider and embark on careers in nursing and healthcare.\nOur approach is to provide a user-friendly interface that showcases local job listings and training sessions for entry-level healthcare professionals. We believe that by making information more accessible and the job search process more intuitive, we can encourage more people to pursue careers in nursing.\nThe Development Journey: Learning and Adapting Developing Oxygen was a learning experience filled with challenges. As students with limited experience in app development, we faced hurdles in understanding and utilizing tools for the first time, like SwiftUI for FrontEnd Development. We spent countless of hours poring over documentation, researching potential stakeholders, seeking advice from mentors, and experimenting with different approaches.\nOne of the most significant challenges was designing an application that was both intuitive and comprehensive. We wanted Oxygen to be more than just a functional tool; it had to be engaging and user-friendly - like Duolingo. This meant constant revisions, user feedback sessions, and adapting our design to align with what potential users found most useful and appealing.\nThe Impact and Future of Oxygen Since its inception, Oxygen has evolved from a simple idea into a platform with the potential to make a real impact. Our focus has always been on the application\u0026rsquo;s utility and relevance to the nursing shortage crisis. As we look to the future, our plans include enhancing Oxygen\u0026rsquo;s features to support career progression, continuous learning, and professional development in nursing.\nThis is an embedded Microsoft Office presentation, powered by Office. In reflecting on our journey with Oxygen, what stands out the most is the sincerity of our mission. We didn\u0026rsquo;t embark on this project for accolades or recognition; our motivation was fueled by a genuine concern for the healthcare sector and a belief in the power of technology to bring about positive change. Oxygen is a testament to what can be achieved when passion, technology, and a desire to contribute to the greater good come together.\n","date":"December 15, 2023","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cpicture\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/02_hu_85206f510e2b3543.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 575px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/02_hu_e72a1b24c8814e64.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 767px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/02_hu_59bd0cdbd555aef6.webp\"  media=\"(max-width: 991px)\"\u003e\n  \u003csource  srcset=\"/images/blog/02_hu_726269234c6f2c3.webp\" \u003e\n  \u003cimg  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/blog/02_hu_721ff29ae7615a.png\"class=\"  img-fluid\" alt=\"\" width=\"3304\" height=\"1867\"\u003e\n\u003c/picture\u003e\n \n \n \n\n","permalink":"/blog/post-2/","title":"Oxygen - Fixing the Nursing Shortage"},{"categories":["Portfolio","Technology"],"contents":"Hello and Welcome!
